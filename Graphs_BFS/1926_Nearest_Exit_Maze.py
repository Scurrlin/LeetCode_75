# You are given an m x n matrix maze (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented
# as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the entrance of the
# maze, where entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol] denotes the row and column
# of the cell you are initially standing at.

# In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step
# into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to
# find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell
# that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.

# Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the
# nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.
