# Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

# The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the
# square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed
# to be a positive integer.

# You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white
# spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that
# the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for
# those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

# The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never
# exceed 105.
