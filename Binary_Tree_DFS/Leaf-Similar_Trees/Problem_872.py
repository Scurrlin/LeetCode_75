# Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values
# of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

# Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is
# the same.

# Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2
# are leaf-similar.
